# SkillForge

**The Official Skill Repository**

---

## Updates

We will soon be deprecating the Forge and KnowledgeBase Directories in favor of ForkedSkills and FordgedKnowledge respectively.

---

## What is SkillForge?

SkillForge is the central hub for new skills. Anyone can contribute—every skill in this repo becomes instantly 
available to all users who enable the skills sync option, after it's approved.

---

## How SkillForge Works

* **All skills live inside the [`SkillForge/ForgedSkills/`](./SkillForge/ForgedSkills) folder** (each skill is a Python file).
* When the program starts, it *automatically downloads and syncs* the latest skills from this repo, if the user has enabled the sync option.
* You never need to download skills by hand unless you want to.

## How to Add a Skill

1. **Fork this repo** (use the “Fork” button at the top right).
2. **Create your skill** following the [SKILL_TEMPLATE.md](./SKILL_TEMPLATE.md).
3. **For more info, also see the (`Template.py`) inside the `SkillForge/Templates/` folder.**
4. **Add your skill** (`yourSkillName.py`) inside the [`SkillForge/ForgedSkills/`](./SkillForge/ForgedSkills) directory of your fork.
5. **Commit and push** your changes to your fork.
6. **Open a Pull Request** back to this repo with a description of your skill, why it’s useful, how to use it (Look at the (`ForgedKnowledge.py`) inside the `SkillForge/ForgedKnowledge/` folder for examples).
7. **Wait for review and approval.** 

---

## How Skills Get Approved

* **All skill submissions are reviewed by the repo owners.**
* Only approved, safe, and useful skills are merged into SkillForge.
* You’ll get comments or feedback if your skill needs fixes.
* Once merged, *all users* will get your skill automatically (if they have the sync option enabled).

---

## Skill Guidelines

* Each skill must be a self-contained file and well-named.
* Include a short docstring at the top of your skill file explaining what it does.
* No malicious code, no hardcoded secrets or credentials.
* Keep it clean, efficient, and fun!
